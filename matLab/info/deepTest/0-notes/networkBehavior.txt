Initialization : net = init(net);
    -check the network's biases and wweights again to see how they have changed
     (net.IW{i,j}, net.LW{i,j}, net.b{i})


Simulation : y =sim(net,x)
    - Before training we can simulate the network to see whether 
      the initial network's response 'Y' is close to the target 'T'

Configuration : net = configure(net, x)
    - After a NN has been created, it must be configured. The configuration step cpnsist of examining input and 
      target data, setting the network's input and output sizes to match the data, and choosing setting for processing
      inputs and outputs that will enabled best network performance.
    - It is the process of setting network input and output sizes and ranges, input preprocessing settings and
      weights initialization settings to match input and target data.

> net = configure(net, x)               : configures only inputs
> net = configure(net, x, t)            : takes I data and T data, and configures the network's I and I to match.
> net = configure(net, 'inputs' , x.i)  
> net = configure(net, 'outputs', t.i)  : configures theI/O specified with the index vector.

!! Configureation must happen before a network's weights and biases can be initialized. Unconfigured networks
   are automatically configured adn initialized the first time train is called.
   Unconfigured networks are automatically configured and initialized the first time train called.
   
   After configuration look again at the weights : net.layerWeights{2,1}
   
   Before the input is applied to the network, it will be processed by two functions : 'removeconstantrows', 'mapminmax'
