1 - Create the matlab code that can be used to reproduce all of  the steps from the
    command line. It can be helpfull to learn how to use command-line functions.

2 - If weare dissatisfid with the network's performance on the original or new data,
    we can do one of the followings:
    > Train it again.
    > Increase the num of neurons.
    > Get another training dataset

3 - If the performance of the training set is good but test set performance 
    is sifnigicantly worse, which could indicate overfitting, then reducing the number 
    of neurons can improve our results.

4 - If training performance of the training set is poor, then we may want to increase
    the number of neurons.
    
5 - To get more experience in command-line operations, here are some tasks:
    > During the training, open a plot and wathc it animation
    > Plot from the command-line with functions.

6 - After the view the regression plot if even more accurate results were required :
    > Reset the initial network weights and biasses to new values with init and train again.
    > Increase the number of hidden neurons.
    > Increase the number of training vectors.
    > Increase the number of input values, if more relevant input is available.
    > Try different training algorithm.
    > Retrain the network, this will change the initial weight and biases of the network.
