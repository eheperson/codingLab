> I assumed that, there is a data point in the test set shose network output is close to 35,
  where the correcponding target value is about 12. There is no any relationship between the target 
  value and network output for this input data.

  The next step would be investigate this ata point to determine if it represent extrapolation
  (i.e. it is outside of the training dataset)
  If so, then it should be included in the training set, and additional data should be
  collected to be used in the test set.
