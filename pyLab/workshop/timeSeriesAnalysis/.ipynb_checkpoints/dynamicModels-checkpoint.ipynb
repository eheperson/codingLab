    "### univariate vs. multivariate :\n",
    "    A time series containing records of a single variable is termed\n",
    "    as univariate, but if records of more than one variable are\n",
    "    considered then it is termed as multivariate.\n",
    "### linear vs. non-linear :\n",
    "    A time series model is said to be linear or non-linear\n",
    "    depending on whether the current value of the series is a\n",
    "    linear or non-linear function of past observations.\n",
    "### discrete vs. continuous :\n",
    "    In a continuous time series observations are measured at every\n",
    "    instance of time, whereas a discrete time series contains\n",
    "    observations measured at discrete points in time.\n",

    "## Components of a Time Series :\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, a time series is affected by four components, i.e.\n",
    "trend, seasonal,cyclical and irregular components\n",

    "### Trend :\n",
    "    The general tendency of a time series to increase, decrease or\n",
    "    stagnate over a long period of time.\n",

    "### Seasional Variation :\n",
    "    This component explains fluctuations within a year during the\n",
    "    season, usually caused by climate and weather conditions,\n",
    "    customs, traditional habits, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cyclical Variation :\n",
    "    This component describes the medium-term changes caused by\n",
    "    circumstances, which repeat in cycles. The duration of a cycle\n",
    "    extends over longer period of time.\n",

    "### Irregular Variation :\n",

    "    unpredictable influences, which are not regular and also do not\n",
    "    repeat in a particular pattern.\n",

    "- A random walk is the process by which randomly-moving objects wander away from where they started.\n",
    "- Consider a simple 1-D process: The value of the time series at time t is the value of the series at time t − 1 plus a completely random movement determined by w_t. More generally, a constant drift factor δ is introduced.\n",

    "- The procedure of using known data values to fit a time series with suitable model and estimating the corresponding parameters. It comprises methods that attempt to understand the nature of the time series and is often useful for future forecasting and simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Process :\n",
    "- There are several ways to build time series forecasting models,but we will focus on stochastic process.\n",
    "- Stochastic means that the values come from a random probability distribution, which can be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely."
