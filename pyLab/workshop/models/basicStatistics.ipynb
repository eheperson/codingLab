    "### statistics\n",
    "- Python’s statistics is a built-in Python library for descriptive statistics. You can use it if your datasets are not too large or if you can’t rely on importing other libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numpy\n",
    "- NumPy is a third-party library for numerical computing, optimized for working with single- and multi-dimensional arrays. Its primary type is the array type called ndarray. This library contains many routines for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SciPy\n",
    "- SciPy is a third-party library for scientific computing based on NumPy. It offers additional functionality compared to NumPy, including scipy.stats for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas\n",
    "- Pandas is a third-party library for numerical computing based on NumPy. It excels in handling labeled one-dimensional (1D) data with Series objects and two-dimensional (2D) data with DataFrame objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib\n",
    "- Matplotlib is a third-party library for data visualization. It works well in combination with NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outliers :\n",
    "An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from the majority of the data taken from a sample or population. There are many possible causes of outliers, but here are a few to start you off:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural variation in data\n",
    "- Change in the behavior of the observed system\n",
    "- Errors in data collection\n",

    "\n",
    "### Note that you should always be aware of whether you’re working with a sample or the entire population whenever you’re calculating the variance!"
