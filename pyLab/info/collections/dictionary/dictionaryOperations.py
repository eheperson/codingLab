#
#  Change Values
# You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018
#
# Update Dictionary
#   The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument.
#   The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})
#
#
# Adding Items
#   Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)
#
# Update Dictionary
#   The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from a given argument. 
#   If the item does not exist, the item will be added.
#   The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"color": "red"})
#
#
# Removing Items
#   There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:
#
# The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)
#
# The popitem() method removes the last inserted item 
# (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)
#
# The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)
#
# The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:
#
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.
# 
# The clear() method empties the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)
#
#
# Copy a Dictionary
#   You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, 
#   because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, 
#   and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.
#
#!!!!!!!!!! There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().
# Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)
#
#   Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().
#
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)
#
#
