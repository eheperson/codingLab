    "- In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. \n",
    "- In the broadest sense correlation is any statistical association, though it commonly refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You’ll see the following measures of correlation between pairs of data :\n",
    "#### Positive correlation :\n",
    "It exists when larger values of 𝑥 correspond to larger values of 𝑦 and vice versa.\n",
    "#### Negative correlation :\n",
    "It exists when larger values of 𝑥 correspond to smaller values of 𝑦 and vice versa.\n",
    "#### Weak or no correlation :\n",
    "It exists if there is no such apparent relationship.\n",

    "- The correlation coefficient, or Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, is denoted by the symbol 𝑟. \n",
    "- The coefficient is another measure of the correlation between data. You can think of it as a standardized covariance. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/correlation.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value 𝑟 > 0 indicates positive correlation.\n",
    "- The value 𝑟 < 0 indicates negative correlation.\n",
    "- The value r = 1 is the maximum possible value of 𝑟. It corresponds to a perfect positive linear relationship between variables.\n",
    "- The value r = −1 is the minimum possible value of 𝑟. It corresponds to a perfect negative linear relationship between variables.\n",
    "- The value r ≈ 0, or when 𝑟 is around zero, means that the correlation between variables is weak.\n"
